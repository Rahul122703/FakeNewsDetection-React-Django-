üñºÔ∏è Fake Image Detector using Vision Transformer (ViT)

This project is a Fake Image Detector powered by a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model. It includes a complete pipeline for dataset preprocessing, model training, API deployment, and a user-friendly web interface.

üìå Project Overview

This repository contains multiple Python scripts that together enable image classification to detect fake vs. real images.

üìÇ Files and Their Purpose

1Ô∏è‚É£ api.py (FastAPI Backend)

Purpose: Runs a backend API for image classification.

Functionality:

Uses FastAPI to create an API endpoint (/predict/).

Loads a pre-trained ViT model and modifies it to classify fake vs. real images.

Accepts an image upload, processes it using ViTFeatureExtractor, and makes a prediction.

Runs using:

uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

2Ô∏è‚É£ reduce.py (Dataset Reduction)

Purpose: Reduces the dataset size by selecting a limited number of images from each category.

Functionality:

Works on a dataset containing "real" and "fake" images.

Randomly selects num_images from each category and copies them to a new directory.

Used to create a balanced dataset for training/testing.

3Ô∏è‚É£ resize.py (Image Preprocessing - Resizing)

Purpose: Ensures all dataset images have the same size before training.

Functionality:

Iterates through "real" and "fake" images.

Opens each image, resizes it to 224x224 pixels, and saves it back.

Standardizes images for ViT model training.

4Ô∏è‚É£ train.py (Model Training)

Purpose: Trains a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for fake image detection.

Functionality:

Loads the dataset using PyTorch‚Äôs ImageFolder.

Applies transformations (resizing, converting to tensors).

Uses a pre-trained ViT model and modifies the classifier for binary classification.

Moves the model to GPU (if available).

Defines loss function (CrossEntropyLoss) and optimizer (Adam).

Trains for 3 epochs (adjustable).

Saves the trained model as:

vit_fake_image_detector.pth

5Ô∏è‚É£ ui.py (Streamlit Web Interface)

Purpose: Provides a simple web UI for users to upload images and get predictions.

Functionality:

Uses Streamlit to create an interactive interface.

Allows users to upload an image.

Sends the image to the FastAPI backend (api.py).

Receives and displays the prediction (Fake or Real).

Requires the FastAPI backend to be running.
